This class finds PDF links. Useful for making a digital publication.

It relies on pyPdf
http://pybrary.net/pyPdf/

I nabbed the _hasExternalLiks function from the interwebs and adapted it for my findExternalLinks function.
http://trac.egovmon.no/trac/eGovMon/browser/trunk/WAMs/pdf-wam/pdfStructureMixin.py?rev=2188

At some point I hope to rewrite that so that I don't have to have the GPL license in here.

Example of use:

import pdflinkfinder
import cjson

pdf=pdflinkfinder.PdfLinkFinder("newconcept.pdf")
if (pdf.hasExternalLinks()):
	links=pdf.findExternalLinks()
print cjson.encode(links)

Example of result (Three pages, an internal link on the first to the second page, and an external link on the third):
[[{"dest": 1, "pg": 0, "rect": [34, 362, 380, 34], "external": false}], false, [{"dest": "http://www.10layer.com", "pg": 2, "rect": [82, 929, 686, 610], "external": true}]]
